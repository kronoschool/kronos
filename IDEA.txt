====== The future of schooling =====
source: http://etherpad.com/MJfOF9W8xJ


==== Motivation ====

There is a wealth of educational resources on the web in the form
of webpages, books, videos, podcasts and links. There is little or
no coherence between the varied resources and nobody can guide your
learning.

    The problem:    Disorder and disconnect between educaitonal
                    resources on the web.


The solution we propose is to build subject guides for each topic.
Something simple, flexible, extendable --- like a playlist in winamp,
but which can handle ANY type of content.


==== Features ====

For the purpose of this discussion we should split the feature set
into those that we want to implement at first (essential features)
and those that we leave for later on.

Minimum viable product:
 - playlist of links to content
 - note taking
 - subject brakedown (subtopics)
 - curriculum & relations between topics
 - permalinks for topics:  ... /mathematics/calculus/derivatives/
   this is a unique URL that people can link to for that subject


Later on features:
 -  live tutorials/question periods with a "teacher"
    say scheduled for 9pm EST every Monday.
 -  exercises/quizzes/self-assesment quesitons
 -


=== Classes ===

class Course:
    """ Basic container object for a given subject
        maybe should be called "Subject?" or some other catchy name NODE or Knode (knowledge node?)

        the view consists of a bunch of widgets:
         - content list
         - notes
         - subtopics
         - forum


class UniversityCourse:
    """ Special container object for a particular class at a given University
        intended to be a social hub for the students.

        contains:
         - class schedule
         - live note taking (based on schedule)
         - file uploads (for class material)

        Ideally we should be able to pull in all the data automatically from
        the course catalog.


class CourseToUniversityCourseMapping:
    """ this provides an "equivalence" link between one of the courses
        in our system and a given university's version of the course
        for ex:   course:Classical Mechanics   --->  mcgill:PHYS 251  """

        this mapping will allow us to bring people form universities
        the "note taking" feature should perhaps be attached to a particular
        university then...



==== Business model ====

What are we building?
An open community project  or  a business   or  a platform.

The community project is nice, but not self-sustainable. Do people really make money
from those DONATE boxes? I don't know.
A business on the other hand will maybe make it harder to attract seek users.
What can we charge people for? Just we put up some links doesn't mean we can ask
for money. Would companies want to pay to educate their employees?
What if we just build a solid platform for e-learning and let others find ways to
monetize it while giving us a cut. Why would they be able to get money?
Maybe we can market this to univerisites as a replacement for WebCT/Blackboard ?

In general the culture of "free beer" on the internet is so widely spread that
it will be difficult to charge money. We must find a sneaky way to get the dough...


==== Opportunities ====

I preduct the universities as we know them will "go down" fairly
soon and alternative school will show up with closed content that
you have to pay for.
If we operate our site for 2-3 years we will have amassed such a
database of links to quality content that we would kick ass.
The quesiton is how to get people to come to our side and share
content.


=== Comments ===

allow users to create custom courses w/ the material we've collected
use the 37 signals model for monetizing the site ( free accounts but paid upgrades )
